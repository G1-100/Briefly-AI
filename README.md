This is an LLM-powered app that generates daily topic-relevant news for the user. Users can customize and type any topic of their likings, and the app scrapes the internet for the most recent, relevant news on the topic. These articles are then filtered and inputted into Google Gemini to generate the audio broadcast.

Made with the help of GitHub Copilot/Claude.
