MALVERN, Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- Paid Sponsor Partnership: Philadelphia Corporation for Aging

Charles Baker celebrated his 100th birthday last month at Baker Industries in Malvern, Pennsylvania.

""It turned out to be a huge crowd,"" says Baker. ""And it was fun.""

He is still active on the board of the nonprofit he founded in 1980 with his late wife, Weezie.

""Our youngest son has severe epilepsy and was having a really tough time finding work that he could do,"" he says.

He sold his chemical business and founded Baker Industries.

""We kept one product called Nonequal Furniture Polish,"" he says. ""And set it up in the garage, and Justin, our son, and one other guy worked on that.""

It grew from there and the now 45-year-old business continues to help people with disabilities thrive.

""The mission of Baker Industries is to provide employment and bridges to long-term employment for people that are barred from the workforce for various reasons,"" says Nicholas Watson, President of Baker Industries.

""The people who came to work at Baker Industries would learn skills which would be transferable to the regular workplace,"" says Baker.

""We really always want it to be a good business and a supportive organization,"" says Watson.

Employees work with a variety of clients doing light manufacturing, like box building.

""It's boxes that are made and then we have to fold them and package them in some particular way,"" he says. ""We do what's called repackaging, so we work for Tastykake all the time.""

Watson adds that items sent to Baker Industries for repackaging are then put into larger-sized packaging for stores like Costco.

Marcus ""Chill"" Miller has worked here for 19 years.

""They hired me when a lot of people wouldn't,"" says Miller, an employee at Baker Industries. ""Because of my disability, no one would hire me.""

He says the job also helped him out a lot, both financially and getting out of the house and feeling productive. He often does jobs that involve handwriting since he has nice penmanship.

""Everybody's family around here to me,"" he says.

There's also a Job Readiness Program for people struggling with trauma or going through a transition.

Watson says those circumstances can be situations like ""returning from prison or recovering from addiction.""

""And we limit that program to a year,"" he says. ""In addition to working and getting paid for being part of our production lines, they take classes where they're encouraged and supported in having a job search outside.""

Through the years, Baker Industries has helped an estimated 12,000 people through its programs.

""We're the only employer that hopes you get a new, better job as soon as possible and that you're ready to be successful in that,"" says Watson.

""That's success as far as we're concerned,"" says Baker.

As the AI talent wars rage on, Google and other tech giants are shelling out top dollar to lure top talent.

Google has long been revered within Silicon Valley for its generous compensation packages, and its DeepMind unit even resorted to aggressive noncompetes in the UK.

At the same time, Google has made changes to its compensation processes in recent months as others in the tech industry — such as Meta and Microsoft — have sought to weed out low performers.

In April, the search giant changed the way it ranked employees in their yearly performance reviews. Its head of compensation told staff in a memo that ""high performance is more important than ever,"" Business Insider previously reported.

While Google keeps salary data confidential, publicly available work-visa data can provide a glimpse into how much it pays for certain roles. The figures are derived from filings that all companies submit to the Labor Department to obtain work visas for foreign workers.

Google employs thousands of software engineers through this process, and according to the data, they can command salaries as high as $340,000.

It's worth noting that these figures reflect only salaries and don't account for the equity or bonuses that Google employees also receive.

In 2023, BI obtained an internal spreadsheet where thousands of Googlers self-reported their 2022 pay, including some equity and bonus data. Despite the relatively high sums, many said they still felt underpaid.

Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Here's what Google is paying across key roles, based on roughly 6,800 applications from the first quarter of 2025.

PASADENA, Calif. (KABC) -- A chase involving a suspected stolen vehicle ended with multiple crashes in Pasadena Wednesday evening.

One of the crashes involved an LAPD officer in a cruiser who lost control after trying to perform a PIT maneuver. Video shows the cruiser crashing into a business as the Mercedes-Benz ""G-wagon"" continued on.

The suspect in that car eventually crashed with another vehicle a few blocks away near Foothill and Sierra Madre boulevards.

The extent of any injuries is unclear, but the driver of the suspected stolen vehicle was taken into custody.","[0.024308152, -0.0006943251, -0.01232767, 0.01917402, 0.07357939, 0.0028937159,

For some federal workers, Tuesday's Supreme Court ruling on the fate of their jobs landed with a thud — and a shock.

""Omfg,"" one Department of Justice employee responded when a reporter broke the news.

For months, thousands of federal government employees have watched the Department of Government Efficiency tennis match: a legal back-and-forth between the White House and various unions and advocacy groups over DOGE's plan to remake the federal workforce, with tens of thousands of jobs at stake.

On Tuesday afternoon, workers got an answer many had been dreading. The Supreme Courtruled that the Trump administration can proceed with widespread staff cuts at federal agencies.

Whether agencies will follow through with their reduction-in-force plans — and on what timeline — is still uncertain. Elon Musk has said he has stepped back from DOGE, and it's unclear how much sway the cost-cutting outfit still has in directing widespread layoffs.

As the news broke, Business Insider spoke with 16 current federal employees across agencies to gauge their responses. Some were frustrated by the highest courts' decision, while others said they worry essential government services could be at risk. Most used words like ""fear,"" ""uncertainty,"" ""disheartening,"" and ""bleak"" to describe the current energy within their agencies.

Most employees asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional retaliation.

""Many of us were feeling like we could breathe again,"" one Internal Revenue Service worker said. ""That feeling turned on a dime today.""

'We just pretend it's not happening'

Several federal workers told BI that they've been anxiously checking their inboxes and coworker group chats since cuts began last winter.

Some said they were stunned by the SCOTUS ruling and worried about their future livelihoods. A few said they have had to take on a heavier workload amid staffing changes, and have seen morale tank among their coworkers. Others described the stress of financial uncertainty.

""It appears to me as though the Supreme Court has acquiesced to the executive branch,"" said Edwin Osario, a worker at the Social Security Administration. The result, he said, ""will be that hard-working and dedicated civil servants will lose their jobs, and, more importantly, lose their careers that were predicated on serving the American public.""

""I can't see any of this ending well, and I'm scared for my country, my children's future, and my job security,"" a Department of Defense Employee said.

Others, however, weren't surprised. As one Centers for Disease Control employee put it, the feeling they ""could be pushed out at any moment"" is something they've carried to work every day for months.

""We've been planning to hear we're RIF'ed any week since it went to the Supreme Court,"" said an employee at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They anticipate they'll lose their job and will probably have to ""publish data and reports as quickly as possible to tie up loose ends.""

Another Internal Revenue Service employee said they avoid thinking about staff cuts at all.

""It's the only way I'm keeping sane,"" they said. ""Nobody at work talks about it. There's nothing we can do, so we just pretend it's not happening.""

When one Department of Agriculture employee saw the SCOTUS news alert on their phone Tuesday afternoon, they said they just ""packed up and left"" because they knew they wouldn't be able to focus.

Government employees are worried about the future of public services

The Supreme Court ruling stemmed from challenges to a February executive order for a ""critical transformation of the Federal bureaucracy."" The order tasked DOGE with carrying out ""large-scale reductions in force.""

White House spokesperson Harrison Fields called the ruling ""another definitive victory for the President and his administration,"" and said it pushed back against what he described as partisan attempts to obstruct government reform.

Local governments, advocacy groups, and unions like the American Federation of Government Employees sued over the order in April, and a federal judge in California blocked the order in May. The Supreme Court granted a stay on that injunction, which means thousands of current and reinstated workers could now lose their jobs.

Questions still remain. It's not yet known how the decision could play out at individual agencies or exactly how many jobs are at risk.

In the unsigned opinion, the court said that it is taking ""no view"" on the substance of the Trump administration's layoff plans, but it's possible it could rule on their legality in the future.

Most federal workers told BI they believe that potential staff cuts could have serious consequences for the American public, and a few said they feel consistently left in the dark about how DOGE actions will impact their jobs.

And some didn't find out about the decision from the agencies at all.

""I hadn't seen. Well crap. Now I guess we all go back to wondering if today's the day I'll be fired,"" said the IRS employee who said they avoided thinking about the cuts.","[-0.015428963, -0.047075473, -0.0045771035,

American who was wrongfully detained in Iran urges US citizens not to travel to country - CNN,American who was wrongfully detained in Iran urges US citizens not to travel to country  CNN,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 17:20:00 GMT",https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/10/politics/american-detained-iran-urges-americans-not-visit,"{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}","CNN —

An American who was wrongfully detained in Iran joined with the State Department to warn US citizens not to travel to the country “under any circumstances,” and urged those planning to go to “cancel your trip.”

Emad Shargi was among five Americans freed in September 2023 as part of a wider deal between the US and Iran. He spent more than five years imprisoned there.

In a video posted by State Department accounts on X Thursday, Shargi cautioned all Americans, including Iranian-Americans, not to visit.

“Now is a particularly bad time to travel there. I know you may want to visit family and loved ones, but there is a very high risk of arrest and imprisonment by the Iranian regime,” he said. “Trust me, nothing is worth being tortured for and spending years of your life in filthy, dark Iranian jail cell.”

“To anyone planning to travel to Iran, listen to me: cancel your trip,” he said.

Shargi noted that he traveled to Iran to visit family in 2018 and was then arrested on false espionage charges.

“I know this because it happened to me,” he said.

“Before I went to Iran, I thought, ‘This surely won’t happen to you. These things happen to people who have done something wrong, who have said things against the Iranian regime,’” Shargi said.

“I was wrong. Don’t make my mistake. To fellow Iranian Americans, your Iranian background does not protect you. It makes you an even greater target for Iranian authorities to use you as a political pawn,” he said.

Shargi’s warning came as part of a new campaign redoubling longstanding warnings against travel to Iran. It comes following the conflict between Israel and Iran and after unprecedented US military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

A State Department spokesperson said Tehran does not recognize dual nationality but may target dual nationals because of their affiliation with the US. The travel advisory cautions that “Iranian authorities routinely delay consular access to detained U.S. nationals,” and “in particular, Iranian authorities consistently deny consular access to dual U.S.-Iranian nationals.”

The US has no diplomatic presence in Iran and relies on Swiss officials to check on Americans detained there.

“The risk of wrongful detention, or State hostage-taking, may be even greater for Iranian Americans, including dual nationals, as they have been routinely taken and held unjustly by the Iranian regime in the past, held for years on false charges, subjected to psychological torture, even sentenced to death,” Special Envoy Adam Boehler said.

For those who still choose to visit, the State Department has some stark advice: “leave DNA samples” in case your loved ones need them and “draft a will.”","[0.0035659415, 7.56412e-05, -0.0552698,

In a recent court filing, the IRS said that houses of worship in the United States should be allowed to make political endorsements without losing their tax-exempt status.

When Pew Research Center last asked about this in September 2022, 77% of U.S. adults said churches and other congregations should not make political endorsements. Far fewer (20%) said religious organizations should come out in favor of one candidate over another during political campaigns.

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to summarize Americans’ opinions about whether churches should endorse political candidates. The analysis also examines religious services that U.S. congregations posted online in fall 2020. The survey results in this analysis come mainly from a poll of 10,588 U.S. adults conducted online from Sept. 13 to 18, 2022. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education, and other factors. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here is the topline for the Sept. 13-18, 2022, survey, and its methodology. The analysis also includes findings from telephone surveys conducted by the Center between 2002 and 2016. For an analysis of potential complications involved in comparing results from online surveys to findings from telephone surveys, refer to the Center’s Religious Landscape Study. The analysis of texts from religious services shared online is based on 12,832 services from 2,143 U.S. religious congregations – nearly all of them Christian churches – between Aug. 31 and Nov. 8, 2020. This period included the 2020 U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3 and the Sunday following election day. For additional details, refer to “Pastors Often Discussed Election, Pandemic and Racism in Fall of 2020.”

Majorities in both parties said in the 2022 survey that churches should avoid political endorsements: 84% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said this, as did 70% of Republicans and GOP leaners.

There was broad agreement across major religious groups, too. Majorities in every religious category we could analyze in the survey – including Christians, Jews and adults with no religion – opposed the idea. Still, White evangelical Protestants and Black Protestants were more open than people in other religious categories to churches endorsing political candidates.

The Center has asked this question 10 times since 2002. But most of the older surveys were conducted by telephone, whereas the latest survey was conducted online, which means it is not possible to draw direct comparisons between the 2022 findings and the earlier results. Still, every time we have asked this question going back to 2002, most respondents have said churches should not endorse political candidates.

Should churches weigh in on day-to-day social and political matters?

Americans are a bit more inclined to say churches should speak out on social and political issues than to support churches and other houses of worship endorsing political candidates.

In the September 2022 survey, 31% of adults said churches and other houses of worship should express their views on day-to-day social and political questions. (This was considerably higher than the 20% who said churches should endorse individual candidates.)

Still, two-thirds of Americans said churches should keep out of political matters altogether.

Of course, it’s possible that some Americans think churches should be allowed to make political endorsements even if churches should not actually make such endorsements. Pew Research Center has never asked respondents if they think churches should be allowed to endorse candidates without losing their tax-exempt status.

How often do political topics come up in church?

In a 2021 study, the Center analyzed the texts of nearly 13,000 religious services that were shared online by more than 2,000 U.S. congregations – nearly all of them Christian churches – during and immediately after the 2020 presidential campaign.

Overall, 67% of congregations that shared services online posted at least one service that mentioned the election. Of the services that mentioned the election, 46% discussed issues, candidates or parties, while another 20% encouraged voting.

At the same time, the study found that relatively few churches openly campaigned for particular candidates or parties. In fact, explicit endorsements from the pulpit were rare enough that researchers could not develop a machine learning model that would reliably identify such examples in the database we compiled.

Trump names Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as interim head of NASA - CNN,Trump names Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as interim head of NASA  CNN,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 15:05:00 GMT",https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/politics/sean-duffy-named-interim-nasa-administrator,"{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}","CNN —

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he is directing Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to be the interim NASA administrator.

“Sean is doing a TREMENDOUS job in handling our Country’s Transportation Affairs, including creating a state-of-the-art Air Traffic Control systems, while at the same time rebuilding our roads and bridges, making them efficient, and beautiful, again. He will be a fantastic leader of the ever more important Space Agency, even if only for a short period of time. Congratulations, and thank you, Sean,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social Wednesday.

“Honored to accept this mission. Time to take over space. Let’s launch,” Duffy wrote on X shortly after the president’s post.

Trump’s post did not clarify the status of Janet Petro, the director of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida who has been serving as NASA’s interim chief since the start of Trump’s second term. She was still listed as the administrator on the agency’s website Thursday.

In late May, the president rescinded his nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to lead NASA, citing a “thorough review of prior associations.”

The shake-up came just days before the Senate was expected to vote on the nomination of Isaacman, who has twice traveled to space on private missions and has close ties to billionaire and SpaceX chief Elon Musk.

“After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head NASA. I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,” the president said at the time.

CNN has previously reported NASA administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics or public servants. Effectively leading the $25 billion agency — and securing funding for projects NASA hopes to accomplish — routinely requires the agency’s chief to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

The president, discussing Isaacman’s nomination in a long social media post railing against Musk over the weekend, said that he thought it would have been “inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon … run NASA.”

“I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon’s corporate life,” the president wrote in the post.

Musk, formerly a close Trump ally who led the Department of Government Efficiency, departed the administration in early June, and his relationship with the president has broken down in recent weeks following a disagreement over Trump’s sweeping agenda package.

Musk and Duffy sparred at a March cabinet meeting, according to a source familiar, when the Transportation secretary accused the tech billionaire of trying to fire air traffic controllers.

Duffy is not the only member of the president’s Cabinet to take up an additional job outside of their traditional purview. Secretary of State Marco Rubio currently serves as interim national security adviser and national archivist.

"U.S. and Russia have exchanged new ideas for Ukraine peace talks, Rubio says - PBS","U.S. and Russia have exchanged new ideas for Ukraine peace talks, Rubio says  PBS","Thu, 10 Jul 2025 13:34:25 GMT",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/u-s-and-russia-have-exchanged-new-ideas-for-ukraine-peace-talks-rubio-says,"{'href': 'https://www.pbs.org', 'title': 'PBS'}","KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that the U.S. and Russia have exchanged new ideas for Ukraine peace talks after he met with his Russian counterpart in Malaysia Thursday.

“I think it’s a new and a different approach,” Rubio told reporters after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “I wouldn’t characterize it as something that guarantees a peace, but it’s a concept that, you know, that I’ll take back to the president.” He didn’t elaborate.

Rubio added that President Donald Trump has been “disappointed and frustrated that there’s not been more flexibility on the Russian side” to bring about an end to the conflict.

“We need to see a roadmap moving forward about how this conflict can conclude. And then we shared some ideas about what that might look like,” he said of the 50-minute meeting. “We’re going to continue to stay involved where we see opportunities to make a difference.”

In a statement released shortly after Thursday’s meeting, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said that “substantive and frank exchange of views” had taken place on issues including Ukraine, Iran, Syria, and other global problems.

“Both countries reaffirmed their mutual commitment to finding peaceful solutions to conflicts, restoring Russian-American economic and humanitarian cooperation, and unimpeded contact between the societies of the two countries, something which could be facilitated by resuming direct air traffic,” the statement said. “The importance of further work to normalize bilateral diplomatic relations was also emphasized.”

The two men held talks in Kuala Lumpur on the sidelines of the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, which brings together 10 ASEAN members and their most important diplomatic partners including Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, European nations and the U.S.

The meeting was their second encounter since Rubio took office, although they have spoken by phone several times. Their first meeting took place in February in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as the Trump administration sought to test Russia and Ukraine on their willingness to make peace.

Thursday’s meeting occurred shortly after the U.S. resumed some shipments of defensive weapons to Ukraine following a pause, ostensibly for the Pentagon to review domestic munitions stocks, that was cheered in Moscow.

The resumption comes as Russia fires escalating air attacks on Ukraine and as Trump has become increasingly frustrated with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

US diplomatic push could be overshadowed by tariff threats

Rubio was also seeing other foreign ministers, including many whose countries face tariffs set to be imposed Aug. 1.

“These letters that are going out in these trade changes are happening with every country in the world,” Rubio told reporters. “Anywhere in the world I would have traveled this week they got a letter.”

Rubio sought to assuage concerns as he held group talks with ASEAN foreign ministers.

“The Indo Pacific, the region, remains a focal point of U.S. foreign policy,” he told them. “When I hear in the news that perhaps the United States or the world might be distracted by events in other parts of the planet, I would say distraction is impossible, because it is our strong view and the reality that this century and the story of next 50 years will largely be written here in this region.”

“These are relationships and partnerships that we intend to continue to build on without seeking the approval or the permission of any other actor in the region of the world,” Rubio said in an apparent reference to China.

Trump notified several countries on Monday and Wednesday that they will face higher tariffs if they don’t make trade deals with the U.S. Among them are eight of ASEAN’s 10 members.

U.S. State Department officials said tariffs and trade won’t be Rubio’s focus during the meetings, which Trump’s Republican administration hopes will prioritize maritime safety and security in the South China Sea, where China has become increasingly aggressive toward its small neighbors, as well as combating transnational crime.

But Rubio may be hard-pressed to avoid the tariff issue that has vexed some of Washington’s closest allies and partners in Asia, including Japan and South Korea and most members of ASEAN, which Trump says would face 25% tariffs if there is no deal.

Rubio met earlier Thurday with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has warned global trade is being weaponized to coerce weaker nations. Anwar urged the bloc Wednesday to strengthen regional trade and reduce reliance on external powers.

Rubio’s “talking points on the China threat will not resonate with officials whose industries are being battered by 30-40% tariffs,” said Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific during the Obama administration.

When Anwar said “ASEAN will approach challenges ‘as a united bloc’ he wasn’t talking about Chinese coercion but about U.S. tariffs,” Russel noted.

Majority of ASEAN members face major tariff hikes

Among ASEAN states, Trump has announced tariffs on almost all of the bloc’s 10 members.

Trump sent tariff letters to two more ASEAN members Wednesday: Brunei, whose imports would be taxed at 25%, and the Philippines at 20%. Others hit this week include Cambodia at 36%, Indonesia at 32%, Laos at 40%, Malaysia at 25%, Myanmar at 40% and Thailand at 36%.

Vietnam recently agreed to a trade deal for a 20% tariffs on its imports, while Singapore still faces a 10% tariff that was imposed in April. The Trump administration has courted most Southeast Asian nations in a bid to blunt or at least temper China’s push to dominate the region.

In Kuala Lumpur, Rubio also will likely come face-to-face with China’s foreign minister during his visit.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is a veteran of such gatherings and “fluent in ASEAN principles and conventions,” while Rubio “is a rookie trying to sell an ‘America First’ message to a deeply skeptical audience,” Russel noted.

Issues with China remain substantial, including trade, human rights, militarization of the South China Sea and China’s support for Russia in Ukraine.

U.S. officials continue to accuse China of resupplying and revamping Russia’s military industrial sector, allowing it to produce additional weapons that can be used to attack Ukraine.

Earlier on Thursday, Rubio signed a memorandum on civilian nuclear energy with Malaysia’s foreign minister, which will pave the way for negotiations on a more formal nuclear cooperation deal, known as a 123 agreement after the section of U.S. law allowing such programs.

Those agreements allow the U.S. government and U.S. companies to work with and invest in civilian energy nuclear programs in other countries under strict supervision.

UPA teams with PlayReplay for line-calling tech - Sports Business Journal,UPA teams with PlayReplay for line-calling tech  Sports Business Journal,"Wed, 09 Jul 2025 17:11:45 GMT",https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/07/09/united-pickleball-association-partners-with-playreplay-for-elc-tech/,"{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","The United Pickleball Association has signed a partnership with electronic line-calling technology vendor PlayReplay and plans to implement its tech across the PPA Tour and Major League Pickleball, likely within the next two years.

Under its current rules, UPA players call their own lines and are afforded video-based challenges if playing on one of an event’s two main, camera-equipped courts. UPA CEO Connor Pardoe said the vision is for PlayReplay’s system to roll out across all eight competition courts the UPA utilizes per event, although it is still yet to be determined whether the courts would utilize PlayReplay’s technology for live line-calling, or uber-precise challenges.

“We think there’s a problem in general with pickleball line-calling,” Pardoe told SBJ. “A lot of the time, all four players are at the net and the ball passes you, and the question is, ‘Is that ball in or is it out?’ One team hit the ball and is biased and is watching their own ball. The other team is flipping their head around as quick as they can, trying to see if the ball is in or out. It makes line-calling even more controversial than what you would see in recreational tennis, junior tennis, maybe even college tennis.”

Pardoe said precise financial terms of the partnership are still being finalized, but that another appeal was PlayReplay being more affordable and lightweight than more established line-calling solutions like Hawk-Eye. The UPA-PlayReplay deal will also see the UPA become PlayReplay’s “official pickleball distributor,” according to Pardoe, meaning they will act as an extension of PlayReplay’s product distribution arm at pickleball clubs.

Pardoe added that the UPA is planning to shift its athlete compensation model to be weighted further towards prize money, rather than guaranteed contracts, raising the stakes of match integrity further.

“One of the number one concerns we had from pro players was: ‘As soon as we move to [the prize money model], there’s so much on the line for every single point, we’re really worried about cheating,’” Pardoe said. “As soon as we get to that prize money model -- we’re hoping it’s next year, it might be the year after, but we’re hoping it’s as soon as possible -- then we’ll have this line-calling technology for all pro courts at all PPA and MLP events.”

PlayReplay’s ELC system, which has primarily been used for tennis since the Stockholm-based startup was founded in 2019, is comprised of four net-post-affixed, AI-powered cameras that track ball coordinates and other metrics. USTA Ventures invested in the company last year and has been demoing it at ITF Pro Circuit tournaments. PlayReplay also began working with the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) last year on a pilot program for ELC in college tennis.

Looking ahead, PlayReplay’s system additionally collects match analytics (e.g., ball spin rate) that the UPA could look to leverage once the cameras are in place.

“Our hope is, first, let’s get the line-calling -- and then, two, what made these guys interesting is you then can go further than that, it goes into actually data and analytics,” Pardoe said. “We just want to create the best thing for players to be able to understand their own game, understand their opponent’s game, and for fans to be able to learn more about the sport.”","[-0.05743292,
